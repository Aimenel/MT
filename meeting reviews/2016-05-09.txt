Done:
- scala map (x => somestuff(x, x+2, 13)
- unfolding && folding predicates => quantified permissions?

To Do:
- implement quantified predicate support (inhale, exhale priorized)
- test
- mail on thursday midday.

Probably won't have to do anything, but have a look at:
- look at predicate version numbers (new on fold)
- look at predicate masks known-folded -> P#sm(...) fields
