Review:
Question about Ref, field, null values:
Ref is like a 'constant pointer'/id. Acc(ref.field).
- Fields defined for every Ref. => Classes via restrictions functions on permissions, i.e.
- null values: acc() ==> not null
- acc does not return a boolean - it is an assertion and no boolean expression.
