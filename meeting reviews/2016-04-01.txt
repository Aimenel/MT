Review:
We went through the example of the paper Automatic Verification of Iterated Separating
Conjunctions using Symbolic Execution to see how a symbolic heap looks like.


Todo:
+ Go through the Viper paper
+ Go through the Iterated Separating Conjunctions paper (once again)
- Setup Toolchain
- Have a look at examples provided (paper and Viper online)
+ Implement example we had a look at.
+ Play with Viper

(
+ Set up repo
+ Documentation scheme
)
